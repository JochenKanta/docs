The new snapshots table makes it easy to view and manage your saved snapshots.

## Getting to the snapshots page
* Cluster -> Saved Snapshots

## Pagination controls / viewing / sorting
* By default shows your most recent 50 snapshots.
* Can click the arrows icon in the column headers to control sorting
* Pagination controls at the top and bottom
* Rows per page also at bottom

## Filtering
* Filter button at the top enables filters
* Each column has its own filter controls, returned resources must match all filters.
* Toggling filters off erases all filters

## Bulk Actions
* Delete single resources with the trash can
* Can select resources using the checkbox on the left of each row
* Can select all with the checkbox in the header - will only select the current page
* Selections persist as you navigate between pages, but bulk actions will only affect rows on the current page. If you can't see it, you can't modify it.
