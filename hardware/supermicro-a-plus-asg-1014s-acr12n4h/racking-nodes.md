This section describes how to use the toolless rail system to attach the rails to your server rack and install {{site.sm1014s}} nodes in your data center.

## Using the Toolless Rail System
{{site.sm1014s}} nodes don't require any tools for attaching rails to your server rack. For more information, see [The Toolless Rail System](https://www.supermicro.com/manuals/superserver/1U/MNL-2436.pdf#page=18) in the Supermicro documentation.


## To Insert the Chassis
For information about inserting the {{site.sm1014s}} node chassis into the server rack, see [Sliding the Chassis onto the Rack Rails](https://www.supermicro.com/manuals/superserver/1U/MNL-2436.pdf#page=21) in the Supermicro documentation.


## To Remove the Chassis
The {{site.sm1014s}} node chassis rest on the inner rail lip of the left and right rails. Two thumb screws secure the chassis to the server rack.

1. Disconnect any cables from the chassis. 

1. Remove one screw from each side of the front of the chassis.

1. Pull the chassis out from the server rack.

1. (Optional) To remove the toolless rails from your server rack completely, see [Removing the Rails](https://www.supermicro.com/manuals/superserver/1U/MNL-2436.pdf#page=22) in the Supermicro documentation.
