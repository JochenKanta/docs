This section explains the LEDs of large form factor (LFF) and small form factor (SFF) drives in your HPE Apollo 4200 Gen10 node. For more information, see [HPE Apollo 4200 Gen10 Server - Document List](https://support.hpe.com/hpesc/public/docDisplay?docLocale=en_US&docId=emr_na-a00061642en_us).

## Large Form Factor (LFF) Drive LEDs

To locate the LFF drive LEDs, use the following diagram.

<!-- Reuse the Gen9 image -->

You can determine the current state of an LFF drive by reviewing the status of the following LEDs:

1. **Fault or UID LED**

   * ðŸŸ  **Amber**
   * ðŸ”µ **Blue**

1. **Online or Activity LED**

   * ðŸŸ¢ **Green**

The following table explains the various combinations of the two LFF LEDs.

### Small Form Factor (SFF) Gen10 Drive LEDs

SFF LEDs can be located using the diagram below:

{% include image.html alt="" file="sff-gen10-led-guide.png" %}

**(1) Locate LED**

-   Solid blue: The drive is being identified by a host application
-   Flashing blue: The drive carrier firmware is being updated or requires an update

{{site.data.alerts.note}}
The Locate LED is located behind the release lever and is visible when illuminated.
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

**(2) Activity ring LED**

-   Rotating green: Drive activity
-   Off: No drive activity

**(3) Drive status LED**

-   Solid green: The drive is a member of one or more logical drives
-   Flashing green: The drive is rebuilding or performing a RAID migration, strip size migration, capacity expansion, or logical drive extension or is erasing
-   Flashing amber/green: The drive is a member of one or more logical drives and predicts the drive will fail
-   Flashing amber: The drive is not configured and predicts the drive will fail
-   Solid amber: The drive has failed
-   Off: The drive is not configured by a RAID controller

**(4) Do not remove LED**

-   _Solid white:_ Do not remove the drive. Removing the drive causes one or more of the logical drives to fail
-   Off: Removing the drive does not cause a logical drive to fail

**(5) Do not remove button**

-   Press to open the release lever

## Resolution

You should now be able to successfully utilize the LED indicators for the LFF and SFF drives on the HPE Apollo 4200 Gen10 servers
