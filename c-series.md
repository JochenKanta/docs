# C-Series 2U (C-168T / C-432T)

## Requirements 
1. Qumulo C Series 168T or 432T Hardware
2. Replacement Chassis on Site

## Replacement Process
1. Shut down the current node via front power button or by running `sudo shutdown -h now` over an SSH connection. 
2. With help available, disconnect all rear cabling on the node and pull from the rack, setting the node down on a flat surface. 
3. Press the large buttons on both sides of the chassis frame to release the lid. The inner components and motherboard should now be exposed.
